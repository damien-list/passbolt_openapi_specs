# How to contribute

1. Please validate your schema and make sure there are no errors.
2. Include both the `yaml` and the `json` files. This makes using them using "out of the box" easy for others. 

You can use https://editor.swagger.io/ to both validate and generate the `yaml` and `json` files.

Once generated send a pull requesting detailing your changes.
